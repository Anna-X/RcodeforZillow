This R Markdown document for demonstating the Monthly Median Rent List Price ($) on Zillow for1-Bedroom in a given state in 2015 is made interactive using Shiny. 
All the data I used is downloaded from Zillow. The data from Oklahoma and Vermont are not available for this topic. 
So there are only 49 states rent price data.

Interactive line chart shows the monthly median rent price trend for each state in 2015.

The interactive histogram and map shows the distribution of median monthly rental across all states for each month.
